# glb2ifc

A small local web app to convert **glTF binary (GLB)** files to **IFC4** with heuristic classification of meshes into walls, slabs, and generic building elements.

> Drag a `.glb` into your browser, get an `.ifc` back. Runs entirely on your machine — no cloud, no upload to any server.

## Why?

GLB is a great format for visualization, but it's purely geometric — it has no notion of "this is a wall" or "this is a floor slab". IFC, the BIM standard, does. Most existing GLB → IFC converters wrap everything in `IfcBuildingElementProxy` (a generic "thing"), which produces a valid file but loses any meaningful BIM semantics.

This tool tries to do slightly better by classifying meshes based on their bounding box geometry:

- **Flat & wide** (vertical span < 0.5m, horizontal span > 1m) → `IfcSlab`
- **Tall & thin** (vertical span > 1m, one horizontal axis < 0.6m) → `IfcWall`
- **Everything else** → `IfcBuildingElementProxy`

It works reasonably well on architectural exports (e.g., from [Pascal Editor](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor)) where buildings have clean wall/slab geometry. Less so on furniture-heavy or organic models.

## Quick start

You need [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org) or [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabBimdata/glb2ifc.git
cd glb2ifc
npm install        # or: bun install
npm start          # or: bun run start
```

Then open <http://localhost:3737> in your browser and drop a GLB file.

## How it works

```
GLB file
   ↓
@gltf-transform/core parses meshes + applies world transforms
   ↓
For each mesh: compute bounding box → classify (wall/slab/proxy)
   ↓
Generate IFC4 STEP-21 text file with:
   • Project → Site → Building → Storey hierarchy
   • IfcTriangulatedFaceSet geometry (preserves original triangles)
   • Y-up (glTF) → Z-up (IFC) axis conversion
   • Proper STEP-21 string escaping
   ↓
IFC file downloaded
```

The IFC writer is a hand-rolled STEP-21 generator (no `web-ifc` or `IfcOpenShell` dependency on the server). The output passes validation in `IfcOpenShell`, BlenderBIM/Bonsai, and FreeCAD.

## Limits & caveats

- **Units**: assumes the GLB is in **meters**. If your file is in millimeters or centimeters, the IFC will be wrong by a factor of 1000 or 100.
- **Single storey**: all elements are placed in one `IfcBuildingStorey`. No automatic floor detection.
- **No materials, no property sets**: only geometry and classification are exported. Textures, colors, glTF materials are ignored.
- **No openings**: doors and windows are not detected as such — they end up as `IfcBuildingElementProxy`.
- **Heuristic is geometric only**: a thin tall pillar will be classified as a wall, a wide flat tabletop as a slab. The classification is meant as a "best effort" starting point, not a substitute for real BIM authoring.
- **Non-ASCII characters in mesh names** are replaced with `_` (proper STEP-21 Unicode escaping is on the TODO list).

## Validating the output

Open the resulting `.ifc` file in any of:

- **[Bonsai (BlenderBIM)](https://bonsaibim.org/)** — open source, the most rigorous IFC viewer/editor
- **[FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)** with the BIM workbench
- **[IfcOpenShell](https://ifcopenshell.org/)** for CLI validation: `ifctester` or `IfcConvert model.ifc model.glb` (round trip)
- Any commercial IFC viewer (Solibri, Tekla BIMsight, etc.)

## Stack

- **Server**: Node.js + Express + Multer
- **GLB parsing**: [@gltf-transform/core](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform) with all extensions registered (handles `KHR_texture_transform` etc. without complaining)
- **IFC writing**: hand-rolled STEP-21 generator (no external IFC library — kept the dependency footprint minimal)
- **Frontend**: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework

## Contributing

PRs welcome! Particularly interesting directions:

- [ ] Multi-storey detection (group meshes by Y altitude bands)
- [ ] Door/window heuristics (small rectangular elements within walls)
- [ ] Property set generation from glTF materials/extras
- [ ] Proper Unicode escaping (`\X2\xxxx\X0\` for non-ASCII chars)
- [ ] Configurable mapping (let users tune classification thresholds)
- [ ] Direct GLB → IFC streaming for large files (current implementation loads everything in memory)
